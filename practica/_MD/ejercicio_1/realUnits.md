For style real, these are the units:

mass = grams/mole
distance = Angstroms
time = femtoseconds
energy = Kcal/mole
velocity = Angstroms/femtosecond
force = Kcal/mole-Angstrom
torque = Kcal/mole
temperature = Kelvin
pressure = atmospheres
dynamic viscosity = Poise
charge = multiple of electron charge (1.0 is a proton)
dipole = charge*Angstroms
electric field = volts/Angstrom
density = gram/cm^dim
